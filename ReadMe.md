# GenAI Assisstant

## Overview

This project is a personal exploration into the inner workings of a Generative AI (GenAI) assistant. The goal is to understand how AI models like ChatGPT function, from handling training data to running code-level operations. By developing this assistant, I aim to gain hands-on experience in machine learning, natural language processing, and AI development practices.

### Project Goals

- Understand the foundational principles of machine learning and AI technology.
- Develop familiarity with training data preparation, model fine-tuning, and evaluation.
- Gain insight into handling model deployment, maintenance, and versioning.

## Getting Started

To Run locally on your machine, download the code and ensure the prerequisites are met.

### Prerequisites

1. Install Necessary libraries:

- `pip install streamlit pypPython.3.12_qbz5n2kfdf2 langchain faiss-cpu`
- `pip install streamlit`
- `pip install python-dotenv`

2. Get a OpenAI API secret-Key from your own OpenAI account: https://platform.openai.com/settings

3) Ensure enough credits are in your account: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview
   ($10- $20, should be fine, you can always add more if it runs out)

4) Run the following command in the correct directory: `python -m streamlit run chatbot.py`
